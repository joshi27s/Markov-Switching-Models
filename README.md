# Markov-Switching-Models

This ongoing research is in its nascent stages. I plan to examine regime shifts and transitional dynamics of business cycle using inflation rate as the primary variable of interest. After testing for stationarity, and normality, I have incorporated primarly two types of models - Markov chain with fixed transitional probabilities with heteroskedasticity, and Markov chain with time varying probabilties.
